//! A contiguous growable array type with heap-allocated contents, written
//! `Vec<T>`.
//!
//! Vectors have *O*(1) indexing, amortized *O*(1) push (to the end) and
//! *O*(1) pop (from the end).
//!
//! Vectors ensure they never allocate more than `isize::MAX` bytes.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! You can explicitly create a [`Vec`] with [`Vec::new`]:
//!
//! ```
//! let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
//! ```
//!
//! ...or by using the [`vec!`] macro:
//!
//! ```
//! let v: Vec<i32> = vec![];
//!
//! let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//!
//! let v = vec![0; 10]; // ten zeroes
//! ```
//!
//! You can [`push`] values onto the end of a vector (which will grow the vector
//! as needed):
//!
//! ```
//! let mut v = vec![1, 2];
//!
//! v.push(3);
//! ```
//!
//! Popping values works in much the same way:
//!
//! ```
//! let mut v = vec![1, 2];
//!
//! let two = v.pop();
//! ```
//!
//! Vectors also support indexing (through the [`Index`] and [`IndexMut`] traits):
//!
//! ```
//! let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
//! let three = v[2];
//! v[1] = v[1] + 5;
//! ```
//!
//! [`push`]: Vec::push

/// A contiguous growable array type, written as `Vec<T>`, short for 'vector'.

/// # Examples
///

/// vec.push(2);
///
/// assert_eq!(vec.len(), 2);
/// assert_eq!(vec[0], 1);

///
/// for x in &vec {
///     println!("{x}");
/// }
/// assert_eq!(vec, [7, 1, 2, 3]);
/// ```
///
/// The [`vec!`] macro is provided for convenient initialization:
///
/// ```
/// let mut vec1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
/// vec1.push(4);
/// let vec2 = Vec::from([1, 2, 3, 4]);
/// assert_eq!(vec1, vec2);

///
/// It can also initialize each element of a `Vec<T>` with a given value.

/// ```
/// let vec = vec![0; 5];

/// let mut vec = Vec::with_capacity(5);
/// vec.resize(5, 0);
/// assert_eq!(vec, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]);
/// ```
///
/// For more information, see
/// [Capacity and Reallocation](#capacity-and-reallocation).
///
/// Use a `Vec<T>` as an efficient stack:
///
/// ```
/// let mut stack = Vec::new();
///
/// stack.push(1);
/// stack.push(2);
/// stack.push(3);
///
/// while let Some(top) = stack.pop() {
///     // Prints 3, 2, 1
///     println!("{top}");
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Indexing
///
/// The `Vec` type allows access to values by index, because it implements the
/// [`Index`] trait. An example will be more explicit:
///
/// ```
/// let v = vec![0, 2, 4, 6];
/// println!("{}", v[1]); // it will display '2'
/// ```
///
/// However be careful: if you try to access an index which isn't in the `Vec`,
/// your software will panic! You cannot do this:
///
/// ```should_panic
/// let v = vec![0, 2, 4, 6];
/// println!("{}", v[6]); // it will panic!
/// ```
///
/// Use [`get`] and [`get_mut`] if you want to check whether the index is in
/// the `Vec`.
///
/// # Slicing
///
/// A `Vec` can be mutable. On the other hand, slices are read-only objects.
/// To get a [slice][prim@slice], use [`&`]. Example:
///
/// ```
/// fn read_slice(slice: &[usize]) {
///     // ...
/// }
///
/// let v = vec![0, 1];
/// read_slice(&v);
///
/// // ... and that's all!
/// // you can also do it like this:
/// let u: &[usize] = &v;
/// // or like this:
/// let u: &[_] = &v;
/// ```
///
/// In Rust, it's more common to pass slices as arguments rather than vectors
/// when you just want to provide read access. The same goes for [`String`] and
/// [`&str`].
///
/// # Capacity and reallocation
///
/// The capacity of a vector is the amount of space allocated for any future
/// elements that will be added onto the vector. This is not to be confused with
/// the *length* of a vector, which specifies the number of actual elements
/// within the vector. If a vector's length exceeds its capacity, its capacity
/// will automatically be increased, but its elements will have to be
/// reallocated.
///
/// For example, a vector with capacity 10 and length 0 would be an empty vector
/// with space for 10 more elements. Pushing 10 or fewer elements onto the
/// vector will not change its capacity or cause reallocation to occur. However,
/// if the vector's length is increased to 11, it will have to reallocate, which
/// can be slow. For this reason, it is recommended to use [`Vec::with_capacity`]
/// whenever possible to specify how big the vector is expected to get.
///
/// # Guarantees
///
/// Due to its incredibly fundamental nature, `Vec` makes a lot of guarantees
/// about its design. This ensures that it's as low-overhead as possible in
/// the general case, and can be correctly manipulated in primitive ways
/// by unsafe code. Note that these guarantees refer to an unqualified `Vec<T>`.
/// If additional type parameters are added (e.g., to support custom allocators),
/// overriding their defaults may change the behavior.
///
/// Most fundamentally, `Vec` is and always will be a (pointer, capacity, length)
/// triplet. No more, no less. The order of these fields is completely
/// unspecified, and you should use the appropriate methods to modify these.
/// The pointer will never be null, so this type is null-pointer-optimized.
///
/// However, the pointer might not actually point to allocated memory. In particular,
/// if you construct a `Vec` with capacity 0 via [`Vec::new`], [`vec![]`][`vec!`],
/// [`Vec::with_capacity(0)`][`Vec::with_capacity`], or by calling [`shrink_to_fit`]
/// on an empty Vec, it will not allocate memory. Similarly, if you store zero-sized
/// types inside a `Vec`, it will not allocate space for them. *Note that in this case
/// the `Vec` might not report a [`capacity`] of 0*. `Vec` will allocate if and only
/// if <code>[size_of::\<T>]\() * [capacity]\() > 0</code>. In general, `Vec`'s allocation
/// details are very subtle --- if you intend to allocate memory using a `Vec`
/// and use it for something else (either to pass to unsafe code, or to build your
/// own memory-backed collection), be sure to deallocate this memory by using
/// `from_raw_parts` to recover the `Vec` and then dropping it.
///
/// If a `Vec` *has* allocated memory, then the memory it points to is on the heap
/// (as defined by the allocator Rust is configured to use by default), and its
/// pointer points to [`len`] initialized, contiguous elements in order (what
/// you would see if you coerced it to a slice), followed by <code>[capacity] - [len]</code>
/// logically uninitialized, contiguous elements.
///
/// A vector containing the elements `'a'` and `'b'` with capacity 4 can be
/// visualized as below. The top part is the `Vec` struct, it contains a
/// pointer to the head of the allocation in the heap, length and capacity.
/// The bottom part is the allocation on the heap, a contiguous memory block.
///
/// ```text
///             ptr      len  capacity
///        +--------+--------+--------+
///        | 0x0123 |      2 |      4 |
///        +--------+--------+--------+
///             |
///             v
/// Heap   +--------+--------+--------+--------+
///        |    'a' |    'b' | uninit | uninit |
///        +--------+--------+--------+--------+
/// ```
///
/// - **uninit** represents memory that is not initialized, see [`MaybeUninit`].
/// - Note: the ABI is not stable and `Vec` makes no guarantees about its memory
///   layout (including the order of fields).
///
/// `Vec` will never perform a "small optimization" where elements are actually
/// stored on the stack for two reasons:
///
/// * It would make it more difficult for unsafe code to correctly manipulate
///   a `Vec`. The contents of a `Vec` wouldn't have a stable address if it were
///   only moved, and it would be more difficult to determine if a `Vec` had
///   actually allocated memory.
///
/// * It would penalize the general case, incurring an additional branch
///   on every access.
///
/// `Vec` will never automatically shrink itself, even if completely empty. This
/// ensures no unnecessary allocations or deallocations occur. Emptying a `Vec`
/// and then filling it back up to the same [`len`] should incur no calls to
/// the allocator. If you wish to free up unused memory, use
/// [`shrink_to_fit`] or [`shrink_to`].
///
/// [`push`] and [`insert`] will never (re)allocate if the reported capacity is
/// sufficient. [`push`] and [`insert`] *will* (re)allocate if
/// <code>[len] == [capacity]</code>. That is, the reported capacity is completely
/// accurate, and can be relied on. It can even be used to manually free the memory
/// allocated by a `Vec` if desired. Bulk insertion methods *may* reallocate, even
/// when not necessary.
///
/// `Vec` does not guarantee any particular growth strategy when reallocating
/// when full, nor when [`reserve`] is called. The current strategy is basic
/// and it may prove desirable to use a non-constant growth factor. Whatever
/// strategy is used will of course guarantee *O*(1) amortized [`push`].
///
/// It is guaranteed, in order to respect the intentions of the programmer, that
/// all of `vec![e_1, e_2, ..., e_n]`, `vec![x; n]`, and [`Vec::with_capacity(n)`] produce a `Vec`
/// that requests an allocation of the exact size needed for precisely `n` elements from the allocator,
/// and no other size (such as, for example: a size rounded up to the nearest power of 2).
/// The allocator will return an allocation that is at least as large as requested, but it may be larger.
///
/// It is guaranteed that the [`Vec::capacity`] method returns a value that is at least the requested capacity
/// and not more than the allocated capacity.
///
/// The method [`Vec::shrink_to_fit`] will attempt to discard excess capacity an allocator has given to a `Vec`.
/// If <code>[len] == [capacity]</code>, then a `Vec<T>` can be converted
/// to and from a [`Box<[T]>`][owned slice] without reallocating or moving the elements.
/// `Vec` exploits this fact as much as reasonable when implementing common conversions
/// such as [`into_boxed_slice`].
///
/// `Vec` will not specifically overwrite any data that is removed from it,
/// but also won't specifically preserve it. Its uninitialized memory is
/// scratch space that it may use however it wants. It will generally just do
/// whatever is most efficient or otherwise easy to implement. Do not rely on
/// removed data to be erased for security purposes. Even if you drop a `Vec`, its
/// buffer may simply be reused by another allocation. Even if you zero a `Vec`'s memory
/// first, that might not actually happen because the optimizer does not consider
/// this a side-effect that must be preserved. There is one case which we will
/// not break, however: using `unsafe` code to write to the excess capacity,
/// and then increasing the length to match, is always valid.
///
/// Currently, `Vec` does not guarantee the order in which elements are dropped.
/// The order has changed in the past and may change again.

/// Vec may use any or none of the following strategies,

/// * preallocate based on [`Iterator::size_hint()`]
///   * and panic if the number of items is outside the provided lower/upper bounds
/// * use an amortized growth strategy similar to `pushing` one item at a time
/// * perform the iteration in-place on the original allocation backing the iterator
///

/// consumption and improves cache locality. But when big, short-lived allocations are created,
/// only a small fraction of their items get collected, no further use is made of the spare capacity
/// and the resulting `Vec` is moved into a longer-lived structure, then this can lead to the large
/// allocations having their lifetimes unnecessarily extended which can result in increased memory
/// footprint.
///
